RPM-Search

Version: 0.01

PURPOSE

This module allows one to search the entire collection of RPMs
available for a given installed Linux distribution that uses RPMs, not
just listing the RPMs already installed on a system.

And frankly, have you tried using "yum search"?

Eventually, I plan to use this functionality to make a plugin for
"cpanminus" to suggest vendor‚Äêsupplied packages instead of building
them "from scratch."

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
